The Last Train Home

Sarah stood on the empty platform watching the clock. It was 11:47 PM and the last train would arrive in three minutes. Around her the station was quiet except for the distant hum of vending machines and the occasional footstep echoing through the corridor.

She checked her phone again. Still no message from Tom. After their argument at dinner she wasn't sure if he'd even want to talk to her tonight. The fight had started over something small how it always did but had quickly escalated into something bigger. Something about trust and honesty and all the things they'd been avoiding for months.

The train pulled into the station with a screech of brakes. Sarah picked up her bag and stepped toward the doors. As they opened she saw him sitting in the second car staring out the window. Their eyes met and for a moment neither of them moved.

Then Tom smiled that familiar crooked smile that had first made her fall in love with him and Sarah knew everything would be okay. Not perfect but okay. She stepped onto the train and the doors closed behind her.

As the train began to move she sat down next to him. For a long moment they didn't speak just sat there in comfortable silence as the city lights blurred past the windows. Finally Tom reached over and took her hand.

"I'm sorry" he said quietly.

"Me too" Sarah replied squeezing his hand.

The train carried them through the dark toward home toward whatever came next. And for now that was enough.
